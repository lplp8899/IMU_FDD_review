# IMU_FDD_review

A review and comparison of representative FDD algorithms for aircraft IMU sensor Fault detection and diagnosis.

This is the code for the following paper:

Q He, W Zhang, P Lu, J Liu, Performance comparison of representative model-based fault reconstruction algorithms for aircraft sensor fault detection and diagnosis, Aerospace Science and Technology, Volume 98, March 2020, 105649.

Four algorithms are implemented:

**Nonlinear disturbance observer, Sliding mode observer, Optimal two-stage EKF and Adaptive two-stage EKF.**

# Usage:

run **main_NDO.m** to see the results using NDO.

run **main_SMO.m**  to see the results using SMO.

run **main_IOTSEKF.m**  to see the results using IOTSEKF.

run **main_ATSEKF.m**  to see the results using ATSEKF.
